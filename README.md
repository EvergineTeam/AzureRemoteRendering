This repository contains an extension to use [Azure Remote Rendering](https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es/services/remote-rendering) in Evergine 3.0.

It provides a set of components and all necessary native dependencies that ease the development of an application using that product.

## Sample

There is a sample app at `Samples/AzureRemoteRendering_Demo`. Before running it, you need to configure it with your Azure Remote Rendering instance. Go to `AzureRemoteRendering_Demo/MainScene.cs`, line 33 and enter your credentials.
